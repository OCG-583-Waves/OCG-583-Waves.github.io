OCG 613 (soon to be 583) Graduate Waves Spring 2026

Welcome to OCG 613 (583) Graduate Waves taught at URI GSO by Prof. Nick Pizzo. My office is Watkins 214.

The goal of this class is to introduce students to linear and nonlinear waves that exist in the ocean and atmosphere. This will include the concept of dispersion, nonlinearity, forcing and dissipation. The class will also develop student's skills in symbolic manipulation software (Mathematica), data analysis (eg Fourier transforms and spectral analysis) as well as conducting and analyzing laboratory experiments corroborating the developed theory. 

Time and Location: Tuesday/Thursday 2-315: OSEC 202.  

Textbooks: There is not one textbook that will cover all of this material. More generally, those who study waves in the ocean often return to simpler systems. There are many online resources that are useful, including Rick Salmon's [notes on waves](https://pordlabs.ucsd.edu/rsalmon/111.textbook.pdf), Myrl Hendershott's notes on [ocean waves](https://oxbow.sr.unh.edu/ChapmanRizzoli/Wave_Motions_in_the_Ocean.html) and Fabrice Ardhuin's [textbook](https://github.com/ardhuin/waves_in_geosciences/blob/main/part1and2.pdf) on surface gravity waves. 

For introductory textbooks on waves, check out "Vibrations and waves" by AP French, "The physics of waves" by H. Georgi. More advanced books are "Waves in fluids" by Lighthill, "The Dynamics of the upper ocean" by Phillips and "Linear and nonlinear waves" by Whitham. "Fluid mechanics" by Kundu and Cohen has background material on fluid mechanics. Finally,"Lectures on GFD" by Salmon and  "Atmospheric and oceanic fluid dynamics" by Vallis will be relevant for geophysical applications. For math background, "Perturbation methods" by Nayfeh and Lancoz's book on "The Variational Principles of Mechanics" are useful. 

Lab assignments: This class will involve a number of in class demonstrations, as well as four laboratory assignments. The labs will be conducted in class and afterwards each student will be responsible for analyzing the data and writing up their results in a formal lab report. 

Homework: There will be a number of homework assignments throughout the semester. 

Collaboration: Students are encouraged to work together but must write up their own solutsion to the homework assignments and laboratory reports. 

Software: This class will involve in class lessons on Mathematica. Students should plan on bringing their laptops to class. Mathematica is available to all URI students (more info [here](https://its.uri.edu/services/it-service-mathematica/)). Jupyter notebooks will also be used. Finally, we will explore LLMs. URI GSO students have access to librechat. However, the use of these tools on the homework assignments will not be allowed. We must learn the basics before applying these tools. 

Grading: Homework 35%, Labs 30%, Midterm 20%, Final project 15%.
